# E-commerce Angular Frontend 🛍️

Hey there! 👋 I'm Ahmed, and this is my e-commerce frontend that I built with Angular! It's been an amazing journey learning Angular, TypeScript, and modern web development while creating this beautiful shopping experience.


## What I Built 🚀

This is a complete e-commerce frontend that connects to my Node.js backend API. I wanted to create something that not only works great but also looks amazing and provides a smooth user experience. From the moment I started learning Angular, I knew I wanted to build something real and useful!

### Why I Built This 💭

I started this project to learn modern frontend development with Angular. It's been incredible seeing how all the pieces come together - from user authentication to shopping cart management, every feature taught me something new about building responsive, user-friendly web applications.

  - Update quantities with real-time validation
  - Persistent cart (your items stay even if you refresh!)
  - Cart total calculations that update instantly

- 👤 **User Authentication & Profile**

  - Clean login and registration forms
  - Password reset with email integration (this was tricky to get right!)
  - User profile management with password changes
  - Secure logout functionality

- 💳 **Checkout & Orders**

## Tech Stack I Used 🛠️

- **Frontend Framework:** Angular 19 (my first time with Angular!)

## What You Need to Run This 📋

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager
- Angular CLI (`npm install -g @angular/cli`)
- My backend API running (or Railway deployment)

## How to Get Started 🚀

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd EcommerceAngular
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure the API connection**
   Update the `baseUrl` in `src/environments/environment.development.ts`:

   };
   ```

4. **Start the development server**
